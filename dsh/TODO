Some wishlist:

     fanout with dshd opening connections, through ssh.
     Some kind of FIFO set up, with something listening onto it.

     Bug with fanout option, rsh requires some quoting. Dsh does not preserve the quotings.


     rsh with timeout : rsh does not time out and fail... bug in rsh ?
